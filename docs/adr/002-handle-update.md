# 1. What the UX of updates to state should be

## Context

In general, Ansible modules allow two `states`, `present` and `absent`. When `state=present`, the resource is created if it does not already exist or is updated. In the case of updating a resource, the Ansible module provides `purge_*` parameters to give the user granular control over the information they wish to update.

Let's take a deep look at how `purge_tags` work in the amazon.aws collection for simplicity:
* When `purge_tags=true` and tags are set, existing tags are purged from the resource to match exactly what is defined by tags parameter.
* If tags parameter is not set then tags are not modified even if `purge_tags=true`.
* When `purge_tags=false` and tags are set, the resource tags are updated with what is defined by tags parameter.

A number of existing Ansible modules support purge_* parameters for different configurations; just to mention a few examples:
* [purge_listeners](https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/blob/main/plugins/modules/elb_application_lb.py)
* [purge_rules](https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/blob/main/plugins/modules/elb_application_lb.py)
* [purge_security_groups](https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/blob/main/plugins/modules/rds_instance.py)
* [purge_iam_roles](https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/blob/main/plugins/modules/rds_instance.py)
* [purge_policies](https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/blob/main/plugins/modules/iam_user.py)
* â€¦

## Preliminary solutions and possible consequencies

### Solution #1: Define a generic purge parameter
For example, we have the following S3 bucket with some tags:

```json
    "s3_bucket_1": {
        "Properties": {
            "BucketName": "pravic-s3-bucket-1",
            "Tags": [
                {
                    "Key": "tag_1",
                    "Value": "Tag1"
                },
                {
                    "Key": "tag_2",
                    "Value": "Tag2"
                }
            ]
        },
        "Type": "AWS::S3::Bucket"
    },
```

Suppose we want to update the S3 bucket, retaining the tags already assigned:

```yaml
    resources:
        s3_bucket_1:
            Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
            Properties:
            BucketName: pravic-s3-bucket-1
            Tags:
                - Key: tag_3
                  Value: Tag_3
```

With the defined state approach that pravic uses, there is no way for the user to add tags to an existing resource, all they can do is define what the final list of tags should be. They would have to know what tags are currently on a resource, and then make sure that those are added to their resource definition. Adding a `purge_tags` option provides the ability to modify the existing set of tags while still using a defined state.

With the new resource modules and implementing only `state=present` will result quite difficult to implement a `purge_*` parameter for each possible property of each resource module. At the same time, the choice not to implement `purge_*` parameters seems to be a missing feature from the user's point of view, who will not have the ability to easily and immediately change the state of resources as desired in a single task.

Another pretty big consequence of this decision is that in the current proposal the new states would be applied across all properties of all resources. Given that the general idea behind pravic is to define a bunch of resources and then have those created at once, this does not leave the user with much control over things.

Hence, one possible approach would be to support a generic purge parameter. In addition, a `state: updated` could be added, allowing the user to explicitly confirm their intention to change the state of the resource.

### Solution #2: Comply to network resource modules

Let's take a look at the network resource modules that support different states ([see](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/network/user_guide/network_resource_modules.html)).

Relating to the previous example, `state=merged` will allow us to accomplish that in one single task. Conversely, if we want to reinitialize resource tags completely, `state=deleted` allows us to do so. `state=replaced`, on the other hand, allows us to replace a resource's existing information with new one.

In addition, `state=gathered`, will allow us to get information on a specific resource.

One proposal is to comply with network resource modules states and implement those for project pravic when it comes to resource update. However, one disadvantage of this approach is that the state strategy (e.g., replaced, merged, absent) alters all the options that are changed in the desired compared to the resource state.

To summarize:
- If `state=merged` or `state=replaced` is used and the resource does not already exist a new one is created. If the resource already exists, the options are altered according to the specified state strategy.
We could use `state=replaced` with an empty list or None value to reinitialize resource properties.
- If `state=deleted`, the resource is deleted.

### Solution #3: Resource-level update stategy
One other alternative is moving this functionality to the resource declaration. We could add another optional field to the resource definition to allow for finer grained control. Something like:

```yaml
    ResourceGroups:
    - ResourceGroupName: cloud1
        Resources:
        bucket_01:
            Options:
                Tags: merged
            Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
            Properties:
            ...
```

The disadvantages of this approach are that it diverges from the network resource modules and it could end up being really tedious having to add this to every resource if you wanted to always use something like `state=merged`.

## Decision
We propose to adopt Solution #2 to handle resource update. The solution partially complies with the behaviour of the network resource modules. Consequently, we propose that the state parameter accept the following values: `deleted`, `replaced` and `merged`.
